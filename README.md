# PrismShellV2
Simple but effective FUD backdoor. How to use it? change the IPs in the server.py file and in the client.py file by putting the same IP on both. To make the backdoor work off the internet, use the IP of one of your C2 servers.


The backdoor can do this:
- VM Checker
- No VM
- No Sandbox
- Anti-Debugger (i will update this function)
- Wait for connection
- Block suspicious hardware components
- Persistence
- Encrypt files with custom key
- Decrypt files
- Exec all commands on system
